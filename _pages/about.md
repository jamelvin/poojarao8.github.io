I am currently working as a [Visiting Postdoc] (http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/cards/raopooja.html) in the Department of Mathematics at Stony Brook University, where I am developing spectral numerical models using eigenbasis of curl operator, to study incompressible flows in turbulent conditions. These methods will be used to study the potential blow up of Navier-Stokes equations in low viscosity regime. My mentor is [Dr. Dennis Sullivan] (http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~dennis/).

Prior to my current position, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

My general area of interest is fluid dynamics and scientific computing. I am interested in studying gas/gas and gas/particle multiphase flows influenced by shock, using high fidelity numerical algorithms. I am also interested in studying coupled heat transfer in porous geometries. For my Ph. D. work in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Stony Brook, I studied turbulent mixing in hydrodynamical instabilties such as Richtmyer-Meshkov and Rayleigh-Taylor, using front-tracking method.
